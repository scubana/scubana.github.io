I'm a Game Design and Development student from New Jersey, currently studying at Rochester Insitute of Technology. I have a passion for arts and I pursue it by freelancing on my off time.

I aim to leave a mark on the game industry by working with awesome people to create ambitous projects. For now, I am looking to utilize my knowledge in web app development and data structures & algorithms, as well as my skills in art to further my studies.
