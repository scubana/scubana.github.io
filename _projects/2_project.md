For this project I designed the enemy types and programming their attack sequences. I created all of the menu splash art as well! This was my first team project larger than a size of two, so through our team meetings I gained a lot of experience in coordination and clear communication. This project I learned that it's important to realize your team's strengths and weaknesses. For example, we were not very good at giving organized and succinct slideshow presentations to present our progress at the end of every milestone, so we compensated by creating videos instead.

    Fun Fact: This is unused enemy art! We decided the overall arcade aesthetic looked best with simpler graphics. That being said, I still really like the designs!
