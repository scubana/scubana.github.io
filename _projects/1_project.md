For this project I acted as lead artist and designed the main character and enemies, as well as their animations. Since we went for a top-down hack n' slash, it was important to have movement and attack animations for every direction for every sprite.

I am happy with the end product and the experience I gained along the way, most of that experience having to do with time management and learning what is expected of an artist in a longer-term project. I became much more familiar with spritesheets, using Animator efficiently, and Timeline-- all in Unity.

    Above are some concept artworks. The first was used in my team's slides when initially pitching the idea for Bloodshed, and the second and third are early iterations of the main character.
    You can see the goat dude was supposed to have a scythe initially, but I had no idea how I'd draw him holding it!

What I enjoyed most was designing the characters, then keeping their designs consistent with their animations. Here are some of the guys doing their idle animations. (clicking on it redirects to game artwork page!!!)

    Fun fact: The game was going to be named "All Hell's Loose" initially, but it was dropped when we had to scale down due to deadlines!
